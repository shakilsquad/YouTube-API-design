                                          The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing
                                          information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a

                                          In JavaScript, var is one of the keywords used to declare variables. However,
                                          it's important to note that var has largely fallen out of favor in modern
                                          JavaScript development, and you should typically use let and const instead.
                                          Here's a brief explanation of var and its characteristics:

                                          In JavaScript, let is a keyword used for variable declaration. It was

                                          In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown
                                          value. For example, let number = null; The code above suggests that the number
                                          variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.

                                          In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents the intentional absence
                                          of any object value or the lack of a value. It is often used to indicate that
                                          a variable or object property should not point to or contain any value. Here
                                          are some key points about null in JavaScript:

                                          Empty Value: null is used to signify that a variable, property, or expression
                                          intentionally has no value. It is not the same as "undefined," which typically
                                          means a variable or property has not been assigned any value.

                                          Type and Equality: In JavaScript, null is a primitive value and has its own
                                          data type called "null." You can use the typeof operator to check the type of
                                          a value, and it will return "object" when applied to null. When comparing
                                          values, null is equal (loose equality, ==) to both null and undefined but not
                                          to any other value.

                                          A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method
                                          or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated
                                          does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was
                                          not returned .

                                          In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value and a data type that represents
                                          the absence of a value or the lack of an assigned value. Here are some key
                                          points about undefined in JavaScript: <br>

                                          been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It can also occur when you
                                          access an object property that does not exist. <br>

                                          <span class="text-3xl font-medium">5.</span>Variable Declaration and Hoisting:
                                          When a variable is declared using var, it
                                          is automatically initialized to undefined. This is part of variable hoisting
                                          in JavaScript. <br>
                                          <span class="text-3xl font-medium">6.</span>Checking for undefined: You can
                                          check if a variable or property is undefined
                                          using the strict equality operator (===). <br>
                                          <span class="text-3xl font-medium">7.</span>It's important to understand the
                                          distinction between null and undefined in
                                          JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, null is used to
                                          indicate the intentional absence of a value, whereas undefined usually
                                          indicates that a value hasn't been assigned or a property doesn't exist. When
                                          checking for missing values or undefined variables, it's often more
                                          appropriate to use undefined.

                                          REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application
                                          Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints
                                          for designing and interacting with web services. It is an approach to building
                                          networked applications and services that rely on the principles of simplicity,
                                          scalability, and statelessness. RESTful APIs are widely used for communication
                                          between web services and clients, including web and mobile applications. Here
                                          are some key characteristics and concepts associated with RESTful APIs: <br> <br>

                                          <span class="font-bold">2.Statelessness:</span> In a REST API, each request from a client to the server must
                                          contain all the information needed to understand and process that request. The
                                          server should not rely on any previous requests or store any client-specific
                                          data between requests. This statelessness makes REST APIs scalable and easy to
                                          understand. 
                                          <br>
                                          <br>

                                          <span class="font-bold">3.Resources:</span>  In REST, data and functionality are modeled as resources, which
                                          can be identified by unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Resources can
                                          represent objects, entities, or services. For example, in a social media
                                          application, user profiles, posts, and comments could be represented as
                                          resources.

                                          <br>

                                          <span class="font-bold"> 4.HTTP Methods:</span> RESTful APIs make use of standard HTTP methods to perform
                                          actions on resources. The four primary HTTP methods used in REST are:

                                          GET: Retrieve data from a resource.
                                          POST: Create a new resource.
                                          PUT: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist.
                                          DELETE: Remove a resource.
                                          These methods are often referred to as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update,
                                          Delete) and map directly to the corresponding actions on resources.

                                          <span class="font-bold">5.Representation:</span>  Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON,
                                          XML, or HTML. Clients can specify the desired representation in the HTTP
                                          request headers, and the server should respond accordingly.

                                          <span class="font-bold"> 6.Stateless Communication:</span> RESTful interactions between the client and server
                                          are stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server should
                                          contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request.
                                          Session state is typically stored on the client side, allowing for better
                                          scalability and load distribution.

                                          <span class="font-bold"> 7.Use of URLs:</span>  Resources are addressed using URLs, and different HTTP methods
                                          are used to perform actions on these resources. For example, to retrieve a
                                          user's profile information, you might use a URL like
                                          https://api.example.com/users/123. 
                                          <br>
                                          <br>

                                          <span class="font-bold">8.HTTP Status Codes:</span>   REST APIs use HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome
                                          of a request. For example, a 200 OK status code indicates a successful
                                          response, while a 404 Not Found status code indicates that the requested
                                          resource does not exist.

                                          <span class="font-bold">9.Authentication and Authorization:</span>  REST APIs often use various authentication
                                          methods, such as API keys, OAuth, or tokens, to verify the identity of clients
                                          and ensure secure access to resources. Authorization mechanisms are used to
                                          control what actions clients are allowed to perform on resources.

                                          <span class="font-bold">10.Statelessness:</span>  Each API request from the client to the server should contain
                                          all the information needed to understand and process that request. The server
                                          should not rely on any previous requests or store any client-specific data
                                          between requests.

                                          <span class="font-bold">11.RESTful APIs</span>  have become a standard for building web services because of
                                          their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. They are widely used in web
                                          and mobile applications, as well as in various other software systems, to
                                          enable communication between clients and servers.
